/**
 * Decide which recording (if any) should be auto-stopped in response to a
 * Recall SDK `meeting-closed` event, and whether to clear the tracked
 * detectedMeeting / user-facing meeting-detected indicator.
 *
 * Pure function: no side effects, no module state, no Electron access.
 * Always pass everything explicitly so the auto-stop decision is unit-testable.
 *
 * Background — the Recall SDK v2 has two distinct quirks that this resolver
 * must distinguish, because v1.4.6 conflated them and caused a regression:
 *
 *   Quirk A: evt.window.id is sometimes `undefined` when a meeting actually
 *     ends cleanly. There is no direct way to identify which recording
 *     corresponds to the closed meeting, so if exactly one recording is
 *     active we stop it. (This is the legitimate v1.4.6 fallback case.)
 *
 *   Quirk B: evt.window.id is sometimes a *valid* windowId for an UNRELATED
 *     window (e.g. a Teams lobby/preview window closing while the actual
 *     meeting window stays open). Stopping the active recording in this case
 *     was the v1.4.6 regression and is what this resolver fixes.
 *
 * Active recording keys can be one of two shapes, depending on which start
 * path was used:
 *
 *   - The SDK windowId itself (auto-detect / `createMeetingNoteAndRecord`
 *     path) — `meeting-closed` for that windowId is a direct match.
 *
 *   - A `prepareDesktopAudioRecording()` key (calendar / quick-record path) —
 *     the closed window's SDK id will never directly match an active key,
 *     even when the user's actual meeting is the one closing. We detect that
 *     case via `detectedWindowId === sdkWindowId`.
 *
 * @param {object} args
 * @param {string|undefined|null} args.sdkWindowId
 *   `evt.window?.id` from the SDK event. May be undefined (Quirk A).
 * @param {string|undefined|null} args.detectedWindowId
 *   `detectedMeeting?.window?.id` — the window the SDK most recently fired
 *   `meeting-detected` for.
 * @param {string[]} args.activeRecordingKeys
 *   `Object.keys(activeRecordings.getAll())` — recording keys currently
 *   tracked by the recording registry.
 * @param {string|undefined} [args.platform]
 *   `detectedMeeting?.window?.platform`. When `'google-meet'`, window absence
 *   is a tab switch, not a meeting end, so no recording is auto-stopped.
 * @param {string|undefined} [args.reason]
 *   Provider-supplied close reason. LocalProvider sets `'browser-exit'` when the
 *   browser process hosting a Meet recording fully exits (the one automatic end
 *   signal for Meet). Absent for ordinary window-absence closes.
 *
 * @returns {{
 *   recordingToStop: string|null,
 *   shouldClearDetectedMeeting: boolean,
 *   requiresConfirmation: boolean,
 *   reason: string,
 * }}
 *   - `recordingToStop`: key to stop, or null if nothing should stop
 *   - `shouldClearDetectedMeeting`: true when the user's known active
 *     meeting actually closed (so detection state should reset)
 *   - `requiresConfirmation`: true when the stop was triggered by window
 *     absence (Zoom/Teams/Meet) and the caller must gate it behind the
 *     "End the recording?" countdown dialog. false for the browser-exit /
 *     process-death backstop (nothing left to record — stop immediately) and
 *     for every no-op (recordingToStop === null). The user's manual stop never
 *     reaches this resolver, so it is never gated.
 *   - `reason`: short tag for diagnostic logging
