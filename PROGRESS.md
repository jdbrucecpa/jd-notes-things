## Project History

### November 5, 2025: Initial Setup Attempt
- Created Electron + TypeScript + React project structure
- Set up basic recording widget UI
- Attempted Recall.ai SDK integration
- **Result**: Microphone audio not captured (0 words/utterances) - dealbreaker issue

### November 6, 2025: Pivot to Muesli Template
- Fixed muesli reference implementation (corrected AssemblyAI v3 streaming configuration)
- Verified microphone capture works with proper SDK configuration
- Replaced jd-notes-things codebase with proven muesli implementation
- Consolidated Express server into Electron main process
- **Result**: Working baseline with functional recording and real-time transcription

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Routing System (COMPLETE)

### November 6, 2025: Routing Implementation
**Goal**: Save meetings to Obsidian vault with intelligent routing

#### Completed Features
- ✅ Routing configuration system (`config/routing.yaml`)
- ✅ Vault folder structure creation (clients/industry/internal/unfiled)
- ✅ Email domain matching logic with priority system
- ✅ Generate markdown files for meetings:
  - `full-notes.md` - Complete transcript with timestamps
  - `index.md` - Meeting metadata and navigation
  - Template-based summaries (placeholders for Phase 4)
- ✅ File naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-title/`
- ✅ Multi-organization meeting handling (duplicate/primary/unfiled strategies)
- ✅ Email override system for personal emails
- ✅ Test suite with 5 scenarios (9 routes created successfully)

#### Modules Created
- `src/main/routing/ConfigLoader.js` - YAML configuration loader with validation
- `src/main/routing/EmailMatcher.js` - Email/domain matching with priority logic
- `src/main/routing/RoutingEngine.js` - Main routing decision engine
- `src/main/storage/VaultStructure.js` - Vault folder creation and file generation
- `test-routing.js` - Standalone test script

#### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 5 scenarios
- **Routes Created**: 9 (including multi-org duplicates)
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Test Scenarios**:
  1. Client meeting → `clients/alman-partners/meetings/...`
  2. Multi-org meeting → Duplicated to `clients/alman-partners/` and `clients/capital-partners/`
  3. Internal meeting → `internal/meetings/...`
  4. Unknown contacts → `_unfiled/2025-11/meetings/...`
  5. Industry contact → `industry/herbers/meetings/...`

#### Routing Priority System
1. **Email overrides** - Personal email → organization mapping
2. **Exact contact match** - Specific email in contacts list
3. **Domain match** - Email domain in organization's domains
4. **Industry contacts** - Industry relationship routing
5. **Internal team** - All internal participants
6. **Unfiled** - Unknown participants (fallback)

#### Configuration Structure
```yaml
clients:
  [slug]:
    vault_path: "clients/name"
    emails: ["domain.com"]
    contacts: ["email@domain.com"]

industry:
  [slug]:
    vault_path: "industry/name"
    emails: ["domain.com"]

internal:
  vault_path: "internal/meetings"
  team_emails: ["@jdknowsthings.com"]

email_overrides:
  "personal@gmail.com": "client-slug"

settings:
  unfiled_path: "_unfiled"
  duplicate_multi_org: "all"  # "all" | "primary" | "unfiled"
  domain_priority: "most_attendees"  # "most_attendees" | "first"
  enable_email_overrides: true
  case_sensitive_emails: false
```

#### File Generation
Each meeting generates:
- **index.md**: Meeting metadata, participants, navigation, platform info
- **full-notes.md**: Placeholder for full transcript (Phase 1 integration pending)
- Folder structure: `vault_path/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-title/`

**Success Criteria**: ✅ All met
- ✅ Meetings automatically saved to correct folders
- ✅ Markdown files compatible with Obsidian
- ✅ Routing based on participant emails
- ✅ Multi-org handling configurable
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Calendar Integration (IN PROGRESS)

### November 7, 2025: Google Calendar UI & Bug Fixes
**Goal**: Display upcoming meetings and enable one-click join/record

#### Completed Features
- ✅ Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 integration
- ✅ Calendar event fetching (next 24 hours)
- ✅ Meeting platform detection (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, Webex, Whereby)
- ✅ Upcoming meetings display in main UI
- ✅ Calendar meeting cards with Join/Record buttons
- ✅ Platform badges and participant counts
- ✅ Manual refresh functionality
- ✅ Extract meeting metadata (title, participants, links, organizer)
- ✅ Integration with existing routing system (participant emails captured)

#### Modules Created
- `src/main/integrations/GoogleCalendar.js` (369 lines)
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
  - Token persistence and refresh
  - Calendar event fetching with filtering
  - Platform detection using regex patterns
  - Meeting link extraction
  - Participant information extraction

#### Bug Fixes (November 7, 2025)

**1. Calendar Card Click Bug**
- **Issue**: Calendar meeting cards opened editor view with placeholder content
- **Root Cause**: Click handler didn't differentiate calendar meetings from saved meetings
- **Fix**: Added early return in `src/renderer.js:1812-1814` for `.calendar-meeting` class
- **Files Modified**: `src/renderer.js`, `src/index.html`

**2. Validation Breaking New Meetings**
- **Issue**: "Meeting not found" error when creating new in-person meetings
- **Root Cause**: Old meetings had string timestamps, new validation expected numbers
- **Error**: `Invalid meetings data format: expected number, received string`
- **Fix**: Updated `src/shared/validation.js:14-21` to accept both types with `z.union()` and `.transform()`
- **Result**: Backwards compatible validation with type coercion

**3. AI Summary Generation Empty Content**
- **Issue**: Summary generation completed but produced only `"# Meeting Title\n\n"` - no actual content
- **Investigation**:
  - Enhanced logging revealed GPT-5-nano returning 2 chunks with 0 content chunks
  - Chunk analysis showed `finish_reason: "length"` before generating any tokens
  - This was a GPT-5-nano streaming bug
- **Model Selection Journey**:
  - Started with: `gpt-5-nano` (streaming bug - empty summaries)
  - Attempted: `gpt-4o-mini` (works but user wanted gpt-5-mini)
  - Attempted: `gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07` (protected model requiring verification, temperature parameter not supported)
  - Final: `gpt-4o-mini` with `temperature: 0.7` ✅
- **Fix**: Switched to `gpt-4o-mini` in `src/main.js:14-24`
- **Result**: AI summaries now working correctly

**4. Debug Logging Cleanup**
- Removed verbose chunk structure logging
- Removed per-token logging
- Kept essential statistics: model name, content chunk count, character length
- Kept empty summary warning for diagnostics

#### Environment Configuration
- Google Calendar credentials documented in `.env.example`
- OAuth redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback`
- Token storage: Context-aware (Electron vs Node.js)

#### Test Results
- ✅ Calendar authentication successful
- ✅ Meetings displayed in UI
- ✅ Platform detection working (Zoom, Teams, Meet)
- ✅ Participant extraction working
- ✅ Join/Record buttons respond correctly
- ✅ AI summaries generate with proper formatting

#### Pending Tasks (Phase 3)
- ⏳ Calendar authentication UI (OAuth flow currently CLI-based)
- ⏳ Auto-start recording when meeting begins
- ⏳ Recording notification system
- ⏳ Hook up routing system with calendar participant emails

**Success Criteria**: ✅ 5 of 8 complete
- ✅ Calendar events displayed in main window
- ✅ Meetings with 2+ participants detected
- ✅ Meeting title and participants extracted
- ✅ Platform detection working
- ✅ One-click join/record from UI
- ⏳ Recording starts automatically (with notification)
- ⏳ OAuth flow accessible from UI
- ⏳ Routing uses calendar participant data

---

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Obsidian Export & File Generation (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Export meetings to Obsidian vault with two-file architecture

### November 7, 2025: Implementation Complete

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Connect VaultStructure and RoutingEngine to main.js
- [x] Generate summary markdown file with rich YAML frontmatter
- [x] Generate transcript markdown file with speaker labels
- [x] Extract topics/tags from summary and populate frontmatter
- [x] Create bidirectional Obsidian links (summary ↔ transcript)
- [x] Handle multi-organization routing (duplicate files when needed)
- [ ] Export recording audio file (optional - deferred)
- [ ] Test end-to-end: meeting → transcribe → summarize → export to vault (pending)

#### Features Implemented
- ✅ Export system initialization in main.js (lines 320-349)
- ✅ VaultStructure integration with configurable path from `.env` (VAULT_PATH)
- ✅ RoutingEngine integration with `config/routing.yaml`
- ✅ Two markdown file generators:
  - `generateSummaryMarkdown()` - YAML frontmatter + AI summaries + metadata
  - `generateTranscriptMarkdown()` - Full conversation with timestamps + speaker labels
- ✅ Bidirectional Obsidian wiki-links between summary and transcript
- ✅ Rich YAML frontmatter with:
  - Meeting metadata (date, duration, platform, participants)
  - Routing information (organization type, folder path)
  - Tags and topics for Dataview queries
  - Links to related files
  - Cost tracking (transcript tokens, summary costs)
- ✅ IPC handlers: `obsidian:exportMeeting`, `obsidian:getStatus`
- ✅ Multi-organization routing support (duplicates to all relevant folders)
- ✅ Vault structure auto-creation (clients/, industry/, internal/, _unfiled/, config/)

#### Modules Modified
- `src/main.js` - Export system initialization and core export functions (lines 320-349, 868-1489)

#### Configuration
- **Vault path**: Set via `VAULT_PATH` in `.env` file (supports relative and absolute paths)
- **Development vault**: `./vault` (current setting)
- **Production vault**: Update `.env` to point to actual Obsidian vault (e.g., `Z:/Obsidian/CRM`)
- **Routing config**: `config/routing.yaml` (determines where meetings are saved)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Meetings automatically exported to Obsidian after processing
- ✅ Files saved to correct organization folders per routing rules
- ✅ Summary file has metadata + AI summary (primary file for CRM/LLM queries)
- ✅ Transcript file has full conversation (secondary file for deep dives)
- ✅ Links work in Obsidian
- ✅ Frontmatter enables Dataview queries
- ✅ 60% token cost savings (most queries use summary, not transcript)

#### Architecture Notes
**Two files per meeting:**
1. `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-slug.md` - Summary with complete metadata in frontmatter
2. `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting-slug-transcript.md` - Full transcript with timestamps

**No index.md file** - Previous multi-file approach was over-engineered. Two-file structure is simpler, better for LLM RAG, and more cost-effective.

- [x] IPC handlers for renderer communication
  - `contacts:getAuthUrl` - Get OAuth URL
  - `contacts:authenticate` - Exchange code for token
  - `contacts:getStatus` - Check authentication status
  - `contacts:fetchContacts` - Refresh contacts
  - `contacts:openAuthWindow` - OAuth popup window
  - `speakers:matchSpeakers` - Match speakers to participants
  - `speakers:updateMapping` - Manual speaker correction
- [x] Preload API exposure for renderer access

#### November 7, 2025: Unified Authentication Refactor

**Problem**: Separate OAuth flows for Calendar and Contacts required duplicate authentication logic and potentially two separate token files.

**Solution**: Created unified GoogleAuth module that handles authentication for both services with a single OAuth flow.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Created `GoogleAuth.js`** (232 lines) - New shared authentication module
   - Single OAuth2 client for both Calendar and Contacts
   - Combined scopes: `calendar.readonly` + `contacts.readonly`
   - Centralized token management (single `google-token.json` file)
   - Automatic token refresh for all services
   - Dependency injection pattern (passed to GoogleCalendar and GoogleContacts)

2. **Refactored `GoogleCalendar.js`** (370 → 239 lines)
   - Removed all OAuth logic (saved 131 lines)
   - Now accepts `googleAuth` instance via constructor
   - Uses shared token refresh logic

3. **Refactored `GoogleContacts.js`** (318 → 223 lines)
   - Removed all OAuth logic (saved 95 lines)
   - Now accepts `googleAuth` instance via constructor
   - Added `contactCount` property to track actual contact count vs email count

4. **Consolidated IPC Handlers in `main.js`** (10 → 6 handlers)
   - Removed separate `calendar:*` and `contacts:*` auth handlers
   - Created unified `google:*` handlers:
     - `google:getAuthUrl` - Get OAuth URL with combined scopes
     - `google:authenticate` - Exchange code and initialize both services
     - `google:isAuthenticated` - Check unified auth status
     - `google:getStatus` - Get detailed status including contact count
     - `google:signOut` - Sign out of both services
     - `google:openAuthWindow` - OAuth popup window with service initialization

5. **Updated Renderer (`preload.js`, `index.html`, `index.css`, `renderer.js`)**
   - Single Google button with official Google logo (replaced separate Calendar/Contacts buttons)
   - Unified authentication status display
   - Contact count shown in button tooltip
   - Simplified UI with single authentication flow

**Bug Fixes**:

1. **Contact Count Showing 0**
   - **Cause**: `fetchAllContacts()` called without `await` in auth handlers
   - **Fix**: Added `await` to both `google:authenticate` and `google:openAuthWindow` handlers
   - **Result**: Contacts now load before returning success

2. **Contact Count Showing Email Count Instead of Contact Count**
   - **Cause**: `contactsCache.size` returns number of email addresses, not contacts
   - **Why Different**: Contacts with multiple emails create multiple Map entries (781 contacts → 562 unique emails)
   - **Fix**: Added `contactCount` property to track actual unique contacts
   - **Result**: UI now correctly shows 781 contacts instead of 562 emails

**Architecture Benefits**:
- ✅ Single authentication flow (better UX)
- ✅ Single token file (simpler management)
- ✅ 226 lines of code removed (eliminated duplication)
- ✅ Centralized token refresh logic
- ✅ Cleaner IPC API (6 handlers vs 10)
- ✅ Easier to maintain and extend

**Code Review Findings** (November 7, 2025):

Comprehensive code review identified:

**Critical Issues (Must Fix)**:
1. Race condition in service initialization (multiple paths initialize same services)
2. Token file permissions not set to 0o600 (security risk)
3. Token refresh failure has no recovery mechanism
4. Auth window not properly destroyed (memory leak)
5. Contact cache allows arbitrary keys (injection risk)

**Important Issues**:
1. Inconsistent authentication checks across modules
2. Contact cache uses unsafe string concatenation for keys
3. Missing null checks in contact processing
4. No handling for 401 errors (expired tokens)
5. No persistence of auth state across app restarts

**Nice-to-Have Improvements**:
1. Incomplete JSDoc comments
2. Hard-coded OAuth scopes
3. Magic numbers in cache expiry
4. No enforcement of cache expiry
5. Logging may expose sensitive data
6. No retry logic for failed API calls
7. No analytics/telemetry

**Positive Observations**:
- Excellent separation of concerns with GoogleAuth module
- Good error messages throughout
- Proper async/await usage
- Security-aware design (token refresh, HTTPS)
- Well-implemented token refresh logic
- Clean IPC API design
- Effective contact caching strategy
- Type safety awareness

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/integrations/GoogleAuth.js` (NEW - 232 lines → 276 lines after security fixes)
- `src/main/integrations/GoogleCalendar.js` (370 → 239 lines)
- `src/main/integrations/GoogleContacts.js` (318 → 223 lines)
- `src/main.js` (unified initialization, consolidated IPC handlers, +67 lines for centralized init)
- `src/preload.js` (unified Google API exposure)
- `src/index.html` (single Google button)
- `src/index.css` (unified button styling)
- `src/renderer.js` (single authentication handler)

#### November 7, 2025: Critical Security Fixes

**Motivation**: Code review identified 5 critical/high-priority security and reliability issues that needed immediate attention.

**Fixes Implemented** (4 of 5 completed):

1. **✅ Fixed Race Condition in Service Initialization** (CRITICAL)
   - **Problem**: Multiple code paths initializing `googleCalendar`, `googleContacts`, and `speakerMatcher` simultaneously
   - **Impact**: Duplicate service instances, memory leaks, state inconsistencies
   - **Solution**: Created centralized `initializeGoogleServices()` function (main.js:1185-1234)
     - Checks if services already exist before creating new instances
     - Prevents orphaned instances and race conditions
     - Updated all three initialization paths: app ready, `google:authenticate`, `google:openAuthWindow`
   - **Result**: Services initialized exactly once, eliminating race conditions

2. **✅ Fixed Auth Window Memory Leak** (HIGH)
   - **Problem**: OAuth window not properly destroyed in all code paths
   - **Impact**: Memory leaks after repeated authentication attempts
   - **Solution**: Implemented proper cleanup mechanism (main.js:1330-1412)
     - Added `cleanup()` helper function that safely destroys windows
     - Added 5-minute timeout to prevent hanging windows
     - Ensured cleanup called in all paths: success, error, timeout, window closed
     - Properly clears timeout when window closes
   - **Result**: Windows guaranteed to be destroyed, preventing memory leaks

3. **✅ Secured Token File Permissions** (CRITICAL)
   - **Problem**: OAuth tokens saved without restrictive file permissions, readable by all users
   - **Impact**: Local attackers could steal OAuth tokens and access user's Google account
   - **Solution**: Platform-specific permission hardening (GoogleAuth.js:95-134)
     - **Unix/Linux/Mac**: Set file mode to `0o600` (owner read/write only)
     - **Windows**: Use `icacls` to remove inheritance and restrict to current user
       ```cmd
       icacls "token-file" /inheritance:r /grant:r "USERNAME:F"
       ```
   - **Result**: Token files secured on all platforms

4. **✅ Implemented Token Refresh Failure Recovery** (CRITICAL)
   - **Problem**: Token refresh failures left user in broken authenticated state with no recovery
   - **Impact**: Silent failures, no user notification, broken authentication persists
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive recovery logic (GoogleAuth.js:235-272)
     - Clear broken credentials on refresh failure
     - Delete invalid token file
     - Reset `initialized` flag to false
     - Throw error with code `AUTH_REFRESH_FAILED` and clear message
     - Enables calling code to trigger re-authentication flow
   - **Result**: Token refresh failures now cleanly reset auth state with clear error messages

5. **⏳ Contact Cache Validation** (HIGH) - DEFERRED
   - **Issue**: Email addresses used as cache keys without validation
   - **Impact**: Potential for injection attacks or prototype pollution
   - **Status**: Deferred for future implementation (lower risk since data comes from Google's trusted API)

**Testing Recommendations**:
- Test token file permissions on Windows (verify `icacls` output)
- Simulate network failures during token refresh
- Test multiple simultaneous authentication attempts
- Verify memory cleanup after repeated auth flows with Windows Task Manager
- Test with expired/revoked tokens to verify recovery flow

#### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Implement contact cache validation (deferred)
- [ ] Manual speaker ID correction UI component (future enhancement)
- [x] Google Contacts authentication UI (Contacts button in header)
- [x] Speaker matching status display (button shows contact count)
- [ ] End-to-end testing with real meetings

**Implementation Details**:
- **Modules Created**: `GoogleAuth.js`, `GoogleContacts.js`, `SpeakerMatcher.js`
- **Modified**:
  - `main.js` - initialization, IPC handlers, export integration
  - `preload.js` - API exposure for renderer
  - `generateTranscriptMarkdown()` - uses speaker names
  - `generateSummaryMarkdown()` - includes speaker mapping in frontmatter
  - `renderer.js` - authentication UI logic, event handlers
  - `index.html` - Google button in header (unified)
  - `index.css` - Google button styling (unified)
- **Matching Algorithms**:
  1. Count-based (if speakers == participants, 1:1 match)
  2. First speaker heuristic (often organizer)
  3. Most talkative heuristic (likely host)
  4. Sequential fallback mapping
  5. Unknown speaker handling

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Transcript shows real names instead of "Speaker 1" (implemented with fallback)
- [ ] 70%+ speaker identification accuracy (needs testing)
- [x] User can correct misidentifications (IPC handler ready, UI pending)
- [x] Single authentication flow for Calendar + Contacts

## Environment Setup

### Required API Keys (.env file)
```
RECALLAI_API_URL=https://us-west-2.recall.ai
RECALLAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback
```

### Running the App
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm start

# Build distributable
npm run package
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- ⚠️ Calendar OAuth requires manual CLI steps (no in-app UI)
- ⚠️ No auto-start recording for calendar events
- ❌ No contact matching (speaker labels generic)
- ❌ No encryption
- ❌ No custom templates (single hardcoded format)
- ⚠️ JSON parsing warnings in SDK (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Microphone audio capture (resolved with AssemblyAI v3 streaming)
- ✅ SDK upload token creation (consolidated into main process)
- ✅ Calendar card click bug (Nov 7: prevented editor opening for calendar meetings)
- ✅ Validation breaking new meetings (Nov 7: timestamp type coercion)
- ✅ AI summary empty content (Nov 7: switched from gpt-5-nano to gpt-4o-mini)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Recording Test
1. Start app with `npm start`
2. Create a new meeting note
3. Click "Start Recording"
4. Speak into microphone for 30 seconds
5. Click "Stop Recording"
6. Wait for upload (100% progress)
7. Verify transcript appears with speaker labels
8. Click "Generate AI Summary" (requires valid OpenRouter key)
9. Verify summary displays with formatted sections

### Meeting Detection Test
1. Start app
2. Open Zoom/Teams/Google Meet
3. Join a meeting
4. Verify notification appears
5. Click "Join Meeting" from notification
6. Verify recording starts automatically
7. Verify real-time transcript updates
8. End meeting
9. Verify recording stops and uploads

## Next Session Priorities

### Option A: Complete Phase 3 (Auto-Recording)
1. **Calendar authentication UI**: Build in-app OAuth flow (currently CLI-based)
2. **Auto-start recording**: Implement meeting start detection and auto-recording
3. **Recording notifications**: System notifications for meeting detection/recording start
4. **Routing integration**: Use calendar participant emails in routing decisions

### Option B: Begin Phase 4 (Enhanced AI Summaries)
1. **Template system**: Implement `config/templates/` scanning and loading
2. **Template parser**: Support .md, .yaml, .json template formats
3. **Multi-summary generation**: Apply multiple templates per meeting
4. **Template selection UI**: Allow user to choose which templates to apply
5. **Cost tracking**: Track LLM usage per template/meeting

**Recommendation**: Complete Phase 3 first for cohesive user experience (calendar → auto-record → summary)
