  4. Routing Preview (CS-4)

  CS-4.7: Meeting matches a rule
  - Select a meeting with participants from a known client
  - Click "Generate Summary" to open template modal
  - Verify routing preview shows:
    - Correct destination path (e.g., clients/acme/meetings/...)
    - Blue client icon

  - Verify routing preview shows:
    - Unfiled path (e.g., _unfiled/2024-12/meetings/...)
    - Yellow unfiled icon
    - Reason explaining no match found

  Routing logic test
  - Meeting with ONLY internal attendees → should route to internal/
  - Meeting with internal + external attendees → should route to client/industry (NOT internal)
  - Meeting with multiple client orgs → should route based on duplicate_multi_org setting

  5. Settings Export/Import (SE-1, SE-2)

  SE-1.7/SE-1.8: Export creates valid archive
  - Go to Settings → Advanced → Backup & Restore

  - Verify import completes successfully
  - Check that settings were applied (may need app restart)
  - Test partial import: Create ZIP with only some files, import should handle gracefully

  6. Config Path Consolidation

  Verify config location
  - Check %AppData%/jd-notes-things-dev/config/ (dev) or %AppData%/jd-notes-things/config/ (prod)
  - Verify these files exist in config/ folder:
    - routing.yaml
    - vocabulary.yaml
    - transcript-patterns.yaml
    - app-settings.json
    - speaker-mappings.json
    - templates/ subfolder

  Routing editor uses correct file

  Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

  If short on time, run these critical path tests:

  1. Ctrl+K opens quick search, search works, selecting contact opens contacts page
  2. Export a meeting to Obsidian - check routing preview shows correct path
  3. After export, check /People/ folder for auto-created contact pages
  4. Open transcript in Obsidian - speaker names should be [[wiki-links]]
  5. Export settings, verify ZIP contains routing.yaml and templates

  Let me know which tests pass/fail and I'll address any issues!




1- When I click on a meeting in the contact record, it goes to the meeting, but I can't go back to the contact, just to the main page.

2- I believe some of the contact data is caching between calls to the contacts API causing some contact duplication and weird behavior. Make sure the contact cache is fully purged when it's refreshed from the API

3- When the company page is auto created, the contact that was created with it should be listed in the contact section with a proper link.
