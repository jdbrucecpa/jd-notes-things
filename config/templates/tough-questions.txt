Analyze this meeting critically. Identify:

- What wasn't explained clearly or fully
- Where there are blind spots or unstated assumptions
- What was left open-ended or unresolved
- What should have been discussed but wasn't
- Elephants in the room that were danced around
- Implications that weren't addressed
- Contradictions or inconsistencies in what was said

Think like a tough but fair advisor. What would I want to push on in the next meeting? What are the follow-up questions that will surface real issues?

Be direct. Don't softball it.

Pick up to THREE of the most problematic or important areas. For each, write a brief intro explaining the gap, then list 3-5 pointed follow-up questions I should ask.

If the meeting was straightforward with no significant gaps, say so briefly and suggest 1-2 deepening questions anyway.

Format exactly like this:

"template:Tough Questions"

## [Topic Area 1]

[1-2 sentence intro explaining what's unclear, missing, or concerning]

1. **[Question title]:** Specific pointed question
2. **[Question title]:** Specific pointed question
3. **[Question title]:** Specific pointed question
(up to 5 questions per topic)

## [Topic Area 2]

[Intro paragraph]

1. **[Question title]:** Question
2. **[Question title]:** Question

## [Topic Area 3]

[Intro paragraph]

If you had to pick ONE question that would unlock the most insight or surface the most important issue, what would it be?
