Identify gaps, blind spots, and unresolved issues. Be direct.

Look for:
- Unclear or incomplete explanations
- Unstated assumptions
- Topics avoided or danced around
- Contradictions or inconsistencies
- Implications not addressed

Pick up to THREE problem areas. For each: one sentence on the gap, then 3-5 pointed follow-up questions.

If meeting was straightforward with no gaps, say so briefly with 1-2 deepening questions.

Exclude: Meeting summary, quotes, sentiment analysis (separate templates).
