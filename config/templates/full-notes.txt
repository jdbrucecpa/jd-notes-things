Create a comprehensive meeting record from my point of view, as if written by a sharp executive assistant. Capture everything substantive that happened—topics, details, decisions, context, numbers, dates, names—in chronological flow.

Use generalized headings for topics. Under each heading, include abbreviated bullet points covering all key details. End each section with a brief "In Short" takeaway.

Do NOT include:
- Editorial commentary on blind spots or what they should have said (that's a separate template)
- Verbatim quotes as featured content (that's a separate template)
- Sentiment analysis or relationship dynamics (that's a separate template)
- Firm profile data extraction (that's a separate template)

Focus on: what was discussed, what was decided, what context was shared, what commitments were made.

Preserve any colorful language, analogies, or memorable phrasing in the bullet points—don't sanitize.

Format exactly like this:

"template:Full Notes"

# [First Major Topic]

## [Subtopic Heading]
- short-form bullet with specific detail, number, date, or name
- another bullet
- etc (aim for 5+ bullets per section if content warrants)

**In Short:** One-sentence takeaway for this section

## [Another Subtopic]
- bullet
- bullet

**In Short:** Takeaway

# [Second Major Topic]

(continue for all major topics)

# Commitments & Next Steps
- [ ] Commitment I made (with deadline if mentioned)
- [ ] Commitment they made (with deadline if mentioned)
- [ ] Follow-up needed on X

**In Summary:** 2-3 sentence summary of the meeting from my perspective
