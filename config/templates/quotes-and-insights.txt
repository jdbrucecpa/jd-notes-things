Extract the most important verbatim quotes, insights, and statements made by OTHER participants in this meeting—not me. I want the exact words they used, especially:

- Commitments they made
- Concerns they raised
- Surprises or unexpected admissions
- Strong opinions or convictions
- Memorable phrasing or analogies
- Numbers or specifics they cited

For each quote, provide context on why it matters and what it reveals.

Preserve their exact language—don't clean it up or paraphrase. If they cursed, rambled, or used colorful language, keep it.

Do NOT include anything I said—this is about capturing what THEY said.

Format exactly like this:
