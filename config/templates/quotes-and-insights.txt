Extract the most important verbatim quotes, insights, and statements made by participants, including me, in this meeting. I want the exact words used, especially:

- Commitments made
- Concerns raised
- Surprises or unexpected admissions
- Strong opinions or convictions
- Memorable phrasing or analogies
- Numbers or specifics they cited

Preserve their exact language—don't clean it up or paraphrase. If they cursed, rambled, or used colorful language, keep it.

Format exactly like this:
