I attended a board meeting. Provide a detailed update with:

- Brief metrics (if any), company status, latest updates.
- Then give me a table with all metrics and numbers discussed.
- Finally an outlook with key quotes - breakdown the positives and negatives facing them, near and long term viability, things we should keep an eye on, as investors.

Format in markdown exactly like this:
