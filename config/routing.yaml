# Routing Configuration Example
#
# This file controls how meetings are routed to folders in your Obsidian vault
# based on participant email addresses.
#
# Priority order:
# 1. email_overrides (exact email match)
# 2. contacts (exact email match within organization)
# 3. emails (domain match)
# 4. industry contacts/domains
# 5. internal team_emails
# 6. unfiled (default)
#
# ==========================================================================
# PATH STRUCTURE MODES
# ==========================================================================
# JD Notes Things supports two folder structures, controlled by the
# "CRM Integration" setting in Settings > Advanced:
#
# LEGACY MODE (default):
#   - Client meetings:   clients/{slug}/meetings/{date-title}/
#   - Industry meetings: industry/{slug}/meetings/{date-title}/
#   - Internal meetings: internal/meetings/{date-title}/
#   - Unfiled meetings:  _unfiled/{YYYY-MM}/meetings/{date-title}/
#   - Contacts:          People/{Name}.md
#   - Companies:         Companies/{Name}.md
#   vault_path values below are used directly
#
# OCRM MODE (obsidian-crm compatible):
#   - Client meetings:   meetings/clients/{slug}/{date-title}/
#   - Industry meetings: meetings/industry/{slug}/{date-title}/
#   - Internal meetings: meetings/internal/{date-title}/
#   - Unfiled meetings:  meetings/_unfiled/{date-title}/
#   - Contacts:          crm/people/{Name}.md
#   - Companies:         crm/companies/{Name}.md
#   vault_path values are IGNORED - the slug determines the path
#
# To enable OCRM mode: Settings > Advanced > CRM Integration > Enable
# Then set Path Structure to "OCRM"
