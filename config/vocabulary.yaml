# Custom Vocabulary Configuration
# ================================
# This file configures custom vocabulary to improve transcription accuracy.
#
# Two types of vocabulary are supported:
#
# 1. spelling_corrections (AssemblyAI)
#    - Maps common mishearings to correct spellings
#    - Format: { from: [variants], to: "correct" }
#    - Applied during transcription
#
# 2. keyword_boosts (Deepgram)
#    - Increases probability of recognizing specific words
#    - Format: { word: "Term", intensifier: 1-10 }
#    - Higher intensifier = stronger boost
#
# Vocabulary is applied in this order:
# 1. Global vocabulary (applied to all meetings)
# 2. Client-specific vocabulary (merged with global for matched clients)

# Global vocabulary - applied to all transcriptions
global:
  # Spelling corrections for common technical terms
  spelling_corrections:
    # Example: AI/ML terms
    # - from: ["ai", "A.I."]
    #   to: "AI"
    # - from: ["gpt4", "gpt 4", "gee pee tee four"]
    #   to: "GPT-4"
    # - from: ["claude", "claud"]
    #   to: "Claude"

  # Keyword boosts for technical terms and proper nouns
  keyword_boosts:
    # Example: Common industry terms
    # - word: "Anthropic"
    #   intensifier: 5
    # - word: "OpenAI"
    #   intensifier: 5

# Client-specific vocabulary
# Keys should match client slugs from routing.yaml
clients:
  # Example client vocabulary:
  # acme-corp:
  #   spelling_corrections:
  #     - from: ["akme", "acme corp"]
  #       to: "ACME"
  #   keyword_boosts:
