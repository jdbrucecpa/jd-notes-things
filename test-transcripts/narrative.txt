"I thought we were pushing this to next week," replied Jordan.
[00:01:42] "No, we agreed to keep the original schedule," Morgan added.
"Okay, then can we at least shorten the financials section?" asked Taylor.

[00:03:10] "That figures… we added three new campaigns," muttered Jordan.
"Exactly, and we also need to cover the churn analysis," said Morgan.
"Fine. Can someone send me the latest churn deck?" Jordan asked.
"I shared it yesterday in the #reports channel," replied Taylor.
[00:05:55] "Perfect, I’ll open that now," said Jordan.
